## Authentication

[Roll auth from scratch just like we did in the haikus project.
The User model should have an "email" and "api_key" fields, but no first name, last name, etc.
Let's persist sessions in a Session model](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/117089935)

Allowing users to sign in and identify themselves is called authentication. Typically, we request an email address and a password to authenticate the user, so we can be sure whoever is signing in is the same person who created the account.
